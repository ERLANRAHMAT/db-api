His bounty before he became a member of the Shichibukai was 340,000,000 Beli.\n\nDoflamingo is a larger than normal blond haired man who generally dresses in flamboyant clothes. In reference to his animal theme, the flamingo, his clothes are brightly colored with his feathered coat being distinctively pink. He also has an odd way of walking, a bow-legged waddle (but does not always do this), which is also a reference to his animal theme. Twenty-two years ago, his hair was longer than currently, had two earrings in his left ear, and he sported a pair of goggles that he wore on his forehead, in addition to his sunglasses that he wears to this day.\n\nHe has a white shirt with red stripes, a green belt, and orange pants with white stripes. Originally in the anime, Doflamingo had a red shirt with black stripes, a purple belt, and black pants with red stripes. However, when he reappeared during the events of Sabaody, his color scheme was switched to its manga depiction with the exception of his glasses. In the manga, he has orange tinted glasses while in the anime, he has purple tinted ones. He is also often, if not always, smiling.\n\nDoflamingo is one of the most carefree characters in One Piece. He seems to have a penchant for dramatic phrasing, as well as a habit of exaggerated posing when giving declarations. He also appears to fear nothing and no one, as he openly taunts Fleet Admiral Sengoku, sits on the table during the Shichibukai meeting and shows only gleeful interest at the thought of warring with Whitebeard. During the Battle of Marineford, all of Doflamingo's interactions have all been for the sake of personal amusement, hinting a sadistic side. He also has an odd habit of sitting in odd positions, like on the back of chairs, on tables, barrels and, even a pile of bodies in the middle of a war zone.\n\nAlthough Doflamingo appeared in the first half of the series frequently, he did not play much of a role until the second half. He is the main antagonist of the Dressrosa Arc and one of the central antagonists of the Pirate Alliance Saga. He is revealed to be an underworld broker, where he operates under the alias \"Joker,\" and during the Dressrosa Arc, it is revealed that he was formerly a World Noble.\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

An avid reader of manga who often saw apocalyptic scenarios playing out, he always responded with the cry of \"I would fight!\" During this time, he and his friends made up a scenario for world conquest in order to play heroes.\n\nFlash forward to 1997, a time where Kenji has taken charge of his families liquor shop and turned it into a convenience store. He is now raising the daughter of his sister, Kiriko (who disappeared immediately after leaving her daughter to Kenji), and living a fairly ordinary life. However, after events from the prophecy he made up earlier begin to come true, he learns of an evil organization, led by a masked man called \"Friend\", which is using his plans to conquer the world. As the organization's hold on the government strengthens, he becomes a wanted man and lives on the streets, continuing to (covertly) oppose Friend, partially through terrorism and partially through a protest song he wrote (named \"Bob Lennon\").\n\nHe supposedly died from an explosion on the Bloody New Year's Eve. However, he survives, although we do not know of any of his actions prior to meeting Damian Yoshida, guitarist of the band the Eroim Esseims, in 2014. It appears that he may have been suffering from amnesia at this time, as he identified himself as the devil (in a reference to the real life Blues legend of Robert Johnson, said to have influenced rock 'n' roll.)\n\nHe then continued to wander Japan until the third year of the Friend era (the era in which Friend was declared president of the world), when a sudden surge of memory causes him to recall his identity.  While heading to Tokyo, he meets up with old friend Konichi, now a radio DJ who, oblivious to Kenji's true identity, records his song (a version of \"Bob Lennon\" with modified lyrics) and subsequently broadcasts it on radio. As Kenji makes his way past border guards now under Friend's control, using charisma and song, he gains more and more of a following. Once he reaches Tokyo, he confronts Friend and watches him and another old friend, Sada Kiyoshi, die together in an explosion. Finally, he reunites with his old friends and niece, and there the story ends.",

At the age of 8, Ash ran away from his home in Cape Cod to escape social pressures and was taken into the custody of Papa Dino, leader of the Corsican Mafia. Since, Ash was groomed and trained to take the Mafia Head's place, and was granted leadership of Manhattan's largest street gang in order to help prepare him for this goal of which he wants no part.

He has a tremendous amount of pride and cares deeply for his country and the people around him. He is also an extremely talented cook. Despite his smart and calculating exterior, Asch has moments of incredible goofiness. At one point he masquerades as Luke and is asked (by someone who had met Luke a few days previously) how his hair had changed from short to long in such a short time. Asch's improvised excuse was, \"My hair grows fast.\" \n\nMost of what Asch does is the \"behind the scenes\" work - though works towards the same goal as Luke and friends. However, most of the time, he outright refuses to work with them. At the end of the game, he even fought Luke over who would fight Van. \n\nAsch openly despises Luke as the person who replaced him. He hates how Luke considers himself (as the clone) to be the inferior one, as not only is he a copy of Asch (and Asch has a tremendous amount of pride) but he was the one who essentially usurped Asch's life with no effort whatsoever. He also considers them rivals in swordsmanship as they are both pupils of Van. \n\nAlthough he thinks that Luke is supposed to be his replacement, and thus the same as him, there are many things in the game that say otherwise. Perhaps the most obvious of these is that Luke's hair is light at the ends, and Asch's is darker. Their clothing is also like this, with Luke's white and gold contrasting with Asch's black and silver. Yet another difference between them is that Luke is left handed, and Asch is right handed. Also, as Luke gradually changes throughout the game, Asch always stays the same. \n\nLuke and Asch fought (due to Asch's stubbornness) at the end of the game to settle the issue over who the \"real\" Luke was. In the end, Luke did win, yet Asch still thought of Luke as his replica. One of his last actions was to take his name back as his own, as a small step in accepting Luke, and acknowledging that he wasn't inferior. \n\nUpon his death, he gave Luke some of his power, allowing Luke to use second-order hyperresonance (and to fully control it at that). It gave Luke the power he needed to finally defeat Sync and Van. \n(Source: Aselia - The Tales Wiki)",

He is one of the bronze saint's most trusted allies, and serves as the man who repairs damaged cloths in the early stages of the series.\n\nMu was introduced by Masami Kurumada in vol. 3 of his manga.\n\nUnder the tutelage of Shion, the Pope of the Sanctuary, Mu was able to become the Gold Saint of Aries at a young age. While all gold saints have a base of psychic powers to some degree, Mu has been stated to possess the strongest raw psychic talent among all living gold saints. This allows him to manipulate his gift to various degrees: psychokinesis, telepathy, teleportation, and various other powers are at his command.\n\nMu is very soft spoken, with a scholarly-like personality; his demeanor is very tranquil and logical, almost as if he is a professor of the Sanctuary. Various official translations of the manga and anime, as well as Mandarin language Saint Seiya fans, tend to refer to the character as 'Lord Mu' or 'Mister Mu'. He is good friends with Taurus Aldebaran, and is very respectful to the 243 yr old master Libra Dohko.\n\nBefore the start of the series, Mu removed himself from Sanctuary after suspecting that his mentor (and then-Pope), Aries Shion, had been quietly assassinated. He relocated to Jamir, a mystical land that only those with a high level of either psychic or Cosmo power can enter. From here, Mu severed all ties to Sanctuary and lived a life of solitude with his apprentice, the young psychic Kiki. It wasn't until years later, when he met Dragon Shiryu and Pegasus Seiya, that he began to become involved in the affairs of Sanctuary again.\n\nThroughout the manga and anime series, Mu is the man to go to when a Saint needs his or her cloth repaired. Although every individual Cloth has the ability to regenerate itself after a battle, a hands-on restoration from Mu is needed if a cloth has been severely damaged to the point of death. In normal cases, 1/3 of a person's total blood supply is required for Mu to begin work right away. When restoring an armor, Mu uses hardware tools and the elements that are used to forge a Cloth: the mythical and extremely rare metal known as Gammanium, used in an alloy with the legendary metal Orichalcum, and finally, the radiant Star Dust Sand.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Athough apparently he's not bad in German either.\n\nLen is a surly, quiet and rather cold violinist who normally behaves contemptuously toward and around everyone. He was a child prodigy, coming from a family of renowned musicians. His mother, Misa Hamai, is a very famous pianist and his father is a well-known violinist. Because of this, many people take his brilliance for granted. He seems very cold towards those that he comes into contact with, even his admirers, to whom he rarely pays any attention.\nBefore he met Kahoko he didn't believe music was enjoyable, though after spending time with her, Len slowly began to enjoy music and his music changes because of her. He slowly warms up to Hino and even gives her advice on how to hold and stand properly with the violin. People think that he acts harshly towards Hino, but deep down in his heart he is really concerned about her (though he may not show it). As the series progresses, he realizes his feelings for her. He's slowly affected by Hino and his mother says that he has changed his character. His mother knows that Hino is the one that affected him or changed his personality. He can also play the piano as well, which may be due to the influence of his famous pianist mother, Misa Hamai. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nAt the end of the manga, he confessed to Hino, they both hugged, Lili hoping for the two to kiss, thus, violin romance occured again.

He lived with his brother Shiro and his grandfather Juuzo, after his parents were apparently killed in a lab accident caused by his grandfather.\n\nOne day, Koji receives a call from his grandfather to meet him at his mountain cabin. Just as Kouji arrives however, the cabin explodes. Searching the remains, he uncovers a hidden doorway into the mountain and inside, he finds his dying grandfather who tells him with his dying wish to pilot \"Mazinger Z\" and stop a man named Dr. Hell.\n\nKouji continues into the hidden lab and discovers the huge, humanoid robot Mazinger Z, and the hover pilder which is used to control it. Honoring his grandfather's last wish, he joins up with the Photon Power Labs and fights the forces of Dr. Hell with his Mazinger Z.\n\nGrendizer\nA supporting character, primarily acting as back up for Duke Fleed, the series protagonist. He enters the war against the Vegan Empire with Duke Fleed and his allies. He initially pilots the TFO, a small recon unit with minimal battle capacity. Later, he fights more directly alongside Duke with the Double Spazer, a jet-like machine with greater firepower that attaches itself to Grendizer and grants it flight capability ala the Scrander.\n\nHis personality is reminiscent of how he is portrayed in the original Mazinger Z anime. He is stubborn, hot blooded, direct, and confrontational. However, he has matured a bit, as was evident in Great Mazinger. He is still likely to be the first to charge into battle, but is more open to reason now.\n\nShin Mazinger\nThe protagonist of the series. Kouji lives with his younger brother Shiro and his grandfather Juuzo in their manor in Atami. Though his grandfather caused the accident that apparently killed his parents, Kouji feels no ill-will towards him and in fact holds him in high regard, attacking anyone who dares insults his grandfather.\n\nDuring the Ashura Corps first attack on Atami, Juuzo sends out the hover pilder to Kouji and tells him to use it to quickly fly home. Just as he reaches the manor, it is utterly obliterated as Juuzo sends out his life's work from his underground lab, the super robot Mazinger Z. After docking the pilder with Mazinger's head, Juuzo tells Kouji that with Mazinger, he has the power to do anything he wants with the world—he could even become a god or the devil. As the ultimate penance for accidentally killing his parents, Juuzo will make his grandson superhuman. Having been granted this new-found power, Kouji decides that he will use it to fight the Kabuto family's long-time enemy—Dr. Hell—and his army of mechanical beasts.",

He has absorbed all the negative aspects of the people he met, failing at everything and losing to everyone at everything. Medaka attempted to reform him, like she had done to her other classmates, but Kumagawa proved to be beyond her influence. Medaka described him as a compulsive liar who places no meaning in trust or doubt. As a negative person by nature, who could kill a person just as easily as he could breathe, Kumagawa thinks nothing of the lives of the people around him and could easily take them away. Despite the immensely negative personality he possesses, he has a purely positive outlook regarding himself and is always seen smiling. As a child, he was tested for abnormalities, but was believed to be normal.\n\nHis minus, \"All Fiction\", allows him to erase the existence of things; this includes things with or without form, injuries, his own \"aura\" and other minuses, as shown when he tried to make Emukae's minus become nothing. \n\nChapter 71 was the first time he expressed a emotion, which was anger (Most of the minus are usually emotionless). As stated by Medaka, he actually does care for his comrades.\n\nLater he traded \"All Fiction\" for his original minus, \"Book Maker\", which allows him to turn the target into a minus. This was proven in his battle against Medaka. After he admitted his own defeat, Kumagawa was given the Student Council Vice-president position by Medaka, which in turn, made him the final member of the Student Council.\nTen years later, Kumagawa's whereabouts are unknown. His message to Medaka from the 100 Flowers Run is revealed to be that he had fun the past four years.\n(Source: Medaka Box Wikia)",

Having no friends, she would stay in her room at all times watching through the window healthier people play outside and counting the leaves on a nearby tree. As an attempt to cheer her up, the Angels paid her a visit, during which she collapsed and asked to be one of the Angels before she dies. Her request was granted.\n\nOnce among their ranks, however, Chitose&rsquo;s tactlessness failed her attempts to make friends and led to her being shunned by most of the Angels. Feeling rejected, she vowed to destroy the Angels and joined the rival Galaxy Twin-Stars as part of her vengeful plan. Thus begun a one-sided antagonism between Chitose and the Angels, as Milfeulle still considers her to be a very good friend and the others having either forgotten who she was or became indifferent. She would later be reassigned back to the Angels and would try to be their friend again as well as destroy them.\n\nAlthough generally a nice and sweet girl, Chitose vacillates between wanting to make friends with the Angels and wanting to kill them. Fortunately, her desire for revenge is hampered by ineptitude and what seems to be bad luck, often inflicting serious harm upon herself rather than others. Unfortunately, her ability to make friends is also mired by ineptitude and bad luck, also resulting in self-injury as well as a renewed determination to kill. In the end, she rejoins the Angels.\n\nAfter her service in both the Galaxy Angels and Galaxy Twin-Stars, Chitose stayed in the military as an accountant at age 21.

The other Angels slowly become concerned of Milfieulle and Takuto's relationship, but Milfie assures them that it's no big deal because she wants Chitose's memory to return completely.\n\nHowever, in volume 2, it is revealed that Chitose has unwittingly been mind-controlled by Noa all along.

He is one of the bronze saint's most trusted allies, and serves as the man who repairs damaged cloths in the early stages of the series.\n\nMu was introduced by Masami Kurumada in vol. 3 of his manga.\n\nUnder the tutelage of Shion, the Pope of the Sanctuary, Mu was able to become the Gold Saint of Aries at a young age. While all gold saints have a base of psychic powers to some degree, Mu has been stated to possess the strongest raw psychic talent among all living gold saints. This allows him to manipulate his gift to various degrees: psychokinesis, telepathy, teleportation, and various other powers are at his command.\n\nMu is very soft spoken, with a scholarly-like personality; his demeanor is very tranquil and logical, almost as if he is a professor of the Sanctuary. Various official translations of the manga and anime, as well as Mandarin language Saint Seiya fans, tend to refer to the character as 'Lord Mu' or 'Mister Mu'. He is good friends with Taurus Aldebaran, and is very respectful to the 243 yr old master Libra Dohko.\n\nBefore the start of the series, Mu removed himself from Sanctuary after suspecting that his mentor (and then-Pope), Aries Shion, had been quietly assassinated. He relocated to Jamir, a mystical land that only those with a high level of either psychic or Cosmo power can enter. From here, Mu severed all ties to Sanctuary and lived a life of solitude with his apprentice, the young psychic Kiki. It wasn't until years later, when he met Dragon Shiryu and Pegasus Seiya, that he began to become involved in the affairs of Sanctuary again.\n\nThroughout the manga and anime series, Mu is the man to go to when a Saint needs his or her cloth repaired. Although every individual Cloth has the ability to regenerate itself after a battle, a hands-on restoration from Mu is needed if a cloth has been severely damaged to the point of death. In normal cases, 1/3 of a person's total blood supply is required for Mu to begin work right away. When restoring an armor, Mu uses hardware tools and the elements that are used to forge a Cloth: the mythical and extremely rare metal known as Gammanium, used in an alloy with the legendary metal Orichalcum, and finally, the radiant Star Dust Sand.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Since, Ash was groomed and trained to take the Mafia Head's place, and was granted leadership of Manhattan's largest street gang in order to help prepare him for this goal of which he wants no part. Much of the manga is in fact dedicated to Ash attempting to escape Papa Dino's wishes for him.\n\nAt a glance, Ash is what many characters refer to in the manga as \"beautiful,\" with shaggy platinum blond hair, pale green eyes, and a slender figure. However, his personality is much less graceful. He's known for sporting a snarky attitude, recklessness, and seemingly cold ability to kill, landing him his fair share of enemies. At the same time, though, his intelligence and charismatic leadership win him an abundance of connections he is always happy to exploit. Special skills include good marksmanship, the ability to hack 80's computers, and a sixth sense for being followed. Despite never having finished high school, Ash reads voraciously and has managed to teach himself advanced math. Ash can even come across as quite cultured when he wants to.\n\nHis later character design was modeled after the actor River Phoenix.",

He is a young, male, golden-yellow, anthropomorphic fox with two tails (similar to the mythological kitsune, or \"yoko\", which was often depicted with up to nine), hence the nickname. He is able to use his two tails to propel himself into the air like a helicopter for a limited time. His debut was in October 16, 1992, taking part in the 8-bit version of Sonic the Hedgehog 2; the 16-bit version was released that November. He is 8 years old, stands at 80cm (2ft 7in), and weighs 20kg (44lbs).\n\nViewing Sonic as somewhat of an older brother, Tails looks up to the hedgehog and aspires to be like him. Though lacking confidence in his abilities as well as experience, Tails does things in a more logical sense than Sonic, often using his ability with machines to turn the tides. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

The man lives a double life: his \"white side\" that is a carefree and goofy man of Portuguese descent who travels with humans that love to play poker, and his sadistic \"dark side\" that has a lust for blood and takes up his role as Noah's descendant (and therefore, one of the antagonists).\n\nTyki and his group suckers Arystar into a game of strip poker, winning literally all his assets, but Allen interferes and plays against them. He wins (with cheating learned from years spent with Cross), and Tyki gives him a pack of playing cards before his group departs.\n\nThe author gives the first hint that something is wrong when the group is revealed to have in their possession a chunk of silver with the name Kevin Yeegar on it - the name of the exorcist general that had recently been killed. In their next encounter, Allen meets Tyki's Noah side, and, after a talk, Tyki leaves him to die from a heart wound inflicted by Tease (a flesh-eating type of golem in the form of a butterfly) after destroying his Innocence, spreading out the same cards he had given Allen over the boy's body. After realizing that Allen's name would not come off the walls of the jail cell, he goes with Jasdero and Debit to find Cross.\n\nTyki's powers stem from his ability to selectively interact with his surroundings. This allows him to become effectively intangible, passing through all manner of matter as a ghost would, or walk on air.\n\nHis powers also have an offensive aspect, allowing him to phase his hand into his opponents' bodies and selectively interact with their organs (i.e. heart), crushing them or tearing them out without leaving any external wounds.\nHe also possesses the ability to reject the existence of space around an area he chooses, which essentially makes it possible for him to create a vacuum around anything he pleases (this ability was put to good effect against Allen, which allowed Tyki to suffocate him in their fight).\n\nHe usually attacks using his powers in concert with the flesh-eating Tease golems given to him by the Earl of Millennium. The Tease themselves are capable of multiplying themselves, becoming a large swarm to consume Tyki's enemies, or change shape to act as shields or throwing blades.\nHe was responsible for the death of Kevin Yeegar, one of the 5 exorcist generals, and has killed over 6 other exorcists himself, including Suman Dark (whom Allen had tried to save), Tina Spark, Gwen Frere, Sol Galen, Kazanna Reed, Chakar Rabon, and Daisya Barry.",

He was shown as being somewhat hostile and talking in an informal, almost humorous way. He also can be bold, aggressive, arrogant and very confident.\n\nIn the past, he believed that the dead of all eras are nothing but refuse. When meeting Sage, he decides to train in the Sanctuary to understand the idea that \"every person who is alive or dead is part of the universe.\"\n\nManigoldo was taught by Sage a large number of techniques related with souls. In direct relation to the oriental folklore pertaining the Cancer constellation, he has the ability to send souls to the entrance to the Underworld with his Praesepe Underworld Waves (Sekishiki Meikaiha)—base technique of Cancer Saints. Using the Praesepe Demonic Blue Flames (Sekishiki Kisoen), Manigoldo creates an orb in his hand, igniting every soul nearby, thus incinerating the souls of his opponents. He is also capable of using the Praesepe Soul Burial Waves (Sekishiki Konsoha) to stray souls nearby as gunpowder to create a great explosion. Apart from the attacks involving souls, Manigoldo can use a physical attack called Acubens in which Manigoldo uses both his legs as pincers of a crab's claw to cut his opponent in half, hence the name.\n\nDuring the series Manigoldo encounters Thanatos, a feat which proves too much and has him almost killed. With the aid of his master Sage, however, he proves to be a challenge for the god. In his last moments, Manigoldo launches a last-ditch attack against Thanatos' physical body, destroying it and in the aftermath being pulverized himself, giving Sage a chance to seal Thanatos away. After the death of Sage, the soul of Manigoldo appears in the Sanctuary and gives to Aries Shion the helmet of the Pope to give it to his teacher.\nHe last appears in spiritual form during the attack of golden light unleashed by the Gold Saints on Hades.",

Chizome entered a private Hero course high school to train to become a Hero. However, Chizome became hopeless and despaired after seeing the school's \"fundamental decay\"; that the students there were becoming Heroes for the money and personal gain. Disillusioned by the reality of Heroics, Chizome dropped out during the summer of his freshman year.\n\nAfter dropping out of high school, the teenaged Chizome preached an ideology which he called the \"Revival of Heroics\" through street oratory speeches and soapbox speeches. However, no one listened to him.\n\nOver the following decade, Chizome realized that only action will create his ideal world and change Heroics for the better; Chizome researched and disciplined himself in the training of the killing arts through self-study; he did this in order to achieve his duty of \"Revival of Heroics\". During this decade, Chizome's parents died (it is unknown what led to their deaths but it is believed that Chizome was not involved).\n\nAfter completing his training in the killing arts, Chizome took up the mantle of Hero Killer Stain and begun advocating the \"Revival of Heroics\". In this ideology of \"Revival of Heroics\", Chizome (now known as Stain) stated the guidelines of being a Hero; that Heroes must not desire rewards or compensation, people can only have the title of Hero when they commit the ultimate acts of self-sacrifice. The ideology stated that the \"Heroes\" of the modern world are fakes who pretend to be Heroes.\n\nStain then begun implementing his \"Revival of Heroics\" by killing Pro Heroes, deciding that he would not stop his purge of the Pro Heroes until the world realized the flaw in the Heroics system. Stain's end goal with implementing his ideology \"Revival of Heroics\" was to create a just world filled with true Heroes.\n\n(Source: Boku no Hero Academia Wikia)",

He, along with Kimura Tatsuya, are known to have been scouted into boxing by Takamura Mamoru, an individual they swore to defeat but eventually came to admire.\n\nAoki was a punk from his childhood up through high school, at which point he encountered, fought and got beat down by Takamura Mamoru (who was then a middleweight with two wins under his belt). This loss motivated him to quit school along with his close friend Kimura Tetsuya to become boxers at Kamogawa gym. Although their initial goal was to land a clean hit on Takamura, they grew to love boxing and develop their own skills. Aoki became a clownish boxer whose signature techniques, the Frog Punch and Look-Away, eventually led him to a draw in a Japanese title match with then-champion Imae Katsuka. Currently in the series, Aoki had a going rivalry with Papaya Dachiu, the lightweight champion of the Philippnes, with whom he has drawn two consecutive matches.\n\nIn a flashback shown in the series, Aoki is known for his troubled school life as a delinquent. He, along with long-time friend Kimura, were known to participate in countless fights and brawls with 'rival' schools. Throughout the series Aoki has shown a rather playful, immature, and mischievous personality- an attitude he reflects in his boxing matches where (due to his comparatively unexceptional boxing skills) he constantly thinks of methods to to deceive, confuse, or even ridicule opponents to a certain extent. A very long-running gag is that Aoki keeps revealing impressing talents, that sadly have no connection with boxing. Another one involves his girlfriend's friendship with Kumi that has made made contacting her far more easy than Ippo could ever hope, so Aoki often helps him out. His prankster personality extends to his own teammates and is most notably reflected in his attitude towards Makunouchi Ippo and (at times) Takamura Mamoru. Together with Kimura he is paired into the Aokimura duo by Itagaki Manabu.\n\nAoki's taste in women is seen as a running joke in the Hajime no Ippo series where, in contrast to the tastes of his gym mates, Aoki places his preferences in women considered 'ugly' by everyone else. This may be due to an incident where he was cruelly dumped by a beautiful girl, psychologically turning him to prefer uglier girls. Even though he may have a taste for \"ugly\" girls, he is able to hold a girlfriend, Tomiko, longer then any of the other guys with the exception of Ippo but it remains to be seen if he and Kumi will ultimately be together.\n\nFor the most part Aoki's fights in the series are not as major or impactive on the general storyline. However, in his most recent fight against Iga Shinobu (and his coach Kurita Baron, a former member of the Kamogawa Gym), Aoki was beaten badly and landed himself in the hospital. Given the option to retire with Kimura after their considerably lengthy careers Aoki refuses, and is determined then to stay in the lightweight class until he defeats Iga, whom he now considers his goal and rival. Takamura is then seen commenting on how stubborn both Aoki and Kimura are.\nCurrent Record\nRank5 (JBC)\nTotal fights: 23\nWins: 12\nWins by ko: 7\nLosses: 8\nDraws: 3",

Using his talent, Lubbock rose through the ranks to the point where he could serve and be by her side. He would also join Najenda in her deflection to the rebellion, even going as far risk his life to change the military records of both him and her to K.I.A. Because of this he shares a somewhat antagonistic relationship with Susanoo who he views as a rival for Najenda's affections.\nIn chapter 52, he is killed by Izou while trying to escape from the imperial palace.",

You can easily tell when he switches between either personality by his expressions. He is very kind looking at one point with his different colored hair down, but when fighting his eyes become evil-looking, veins protrude from his face, making him look like a monster, and his different colored hair sticks up completely. He spent his entire life prior to becoming an Exorcist in a castle and was shunned by the surrounding villagers, who believed he was a vampire because he attacked certain villagers, the way he had attacked them and the fact that he has the stereotypical vampire theme. This is because his teeth were made of Innocence and he was instinctively attacking Akuma, but the villagers did not know that (and, before meeting Allen and Lavi, neither did he). Later, he fell in love with Eliade, not knowing that she was an Akuma. Allen and Lavi (who enjoys teasing Krory in a fight by calling him \"Kro-chan\", or \"Krokins\") later come and recruit him to be an exorcist. He is still getting used to the \"outside world.\"\n\nArystar's Innocence, still unnamed, resides in his teeth, but the strength is in his blood. It grants him a Feral-type ability. When invoked, it gives him great strength, and the ability to drink the blood of akuma, which can allow himself to regenerate and gives him a temporary increase in strength. He is also capable of draining the akuma poison from another person before it can take full effect. However, he is not immune to Akuma poison. Krory's Innocence and body simply break it down (when his body is too weak however, his body cannot fully break down the poison). Krory is also able to remove it from another person by drinking their blood. He can also inoculate his blood on the Akuma, poisoning them and killing them in very few seconds, but this, apparently, weakens him greatly. Taking the commentary of Miranda about the crimson snow that Arystar produced, he named this ability as \"Crimson\". Arystar is also capable of wrapping blood around his hands to fortify the flesh beneath; this is because his Innocence allows him to manipulate the blood in his body and, to an extent, others' bodies. He can even detach the blood from his body to make it nigh invulnerable and wield his max strength remotely as a winged blood mannequin called \"Bloody Krory\"; It appears that after the usage of this technique he becomes exhausted, much like the blood inoculation.",

His nigh-constant hunger is a constant annoyance for his teammates, as sating himself often comes before other necessities such as stealth and teamwork. Because of this, his teammates often use food against him, such as offering him food as a reward for accomplishing a task or simply using his favorite foods as a form of blackmail. Despite his open display for his love of food, Choji is very sensitive about his size and becomes highly agitated when somebody calls him \"fat.\" Once called \"fat,\" Choji's resolve to fight is elevated to new levels and he becomes much more hostile to his opponents than he would otherwise.

        "desc": "Ittou Ogami (拝 一刀)\nOgami Itto seemed to have a very cushy life during Edo-Era Japan, for he had been the Shogun's official executioner (Kogi Kaishakunin). A position so powerful, the term \"Second\" meant that Itto was only second to the Shogun as far as metering out death to unloyal feudal lords throughout the 60 regions of Shogunate controlled Japan. In fact, the Shogun's symbol of the Hollyhock crest was a noticeable part of Ogami's court attire, thus deeming his stature as indeed being the Shogun's final say over his people. The Kogi Kaishakunin was highest of the three positions given to certain clans of samurai under the Shogun to root out corruption amongst the feudal lords who answered to his Highness about the land. The second clan was the Yagyu who assassinated anyone caught doing treasonous deeds. The third clan was the Kurokawa. Shinobi (ninja) sent to spy on daimyos (lords) and report back to the Shogunate.\n\nOgami won his exulted position, by protecting his Highness during the contest to choose the Executioner. The opponent, Gunbei Yagyu, disarmed Itto but blatantly pointed the tip of his sword at the Shogun in his victory over Itto. Ogami seeing this as a direct threat to his Highness stepped in between the sword and the Shogun and thus won the slot of Kogi Kaishakunin. This did not bode well with the ancient patriarch of the Yagyu, Lord Retsudo. Angered that his son lost on a technicality, he plotted against Itto and eventually set off the events that would transform the Shogun's executioner into the assassin known as Kozure Okami (Lone Wolf and Cub).\n\nReturning home from work one evening, Itto finds his pregant wife Azami more fragile than she should be. It seems Lady Ogami has been suffering from terrible nightmares as of late, that the men Itto put to death were cursing the Ogami line. Ogami comforts his wife by explaining if the child they were expecting was a boy, why he chose the name Daigoro. Sadly, Azami's premonition comes true as she is murdered the next day. To further destroy Itto politically and literally, a death tablet bearing the emblem of the Hollyhock crest is placed in the shine he built to pray for the people he was required to execute.\n\nAnd this is where things fall apart, finding his wife dead (and Daigoro cut out of his mother's womb), Itto is devastated. The next morning, the chief inspector of the region (a Yagyu named Bizen), reveals to Itto that he is being tried for treason again his Highness, because of the blasphemous memorial tablet rumored to be in the Ogami memorial shrine. Itto-completely perplexed by such an accusation-agrees to let Bizen investigate the rumor, only to find that there is such a tablet in the shrine!\n\nWhile Bizen expects Itto to accept his fate of seppuku and slay both himself and his newborn son, Ogami soon smells a rat and realizes that the Ura Yagyu (the shadow Yagyu clan led by Retsudo) are behind this plot to undo him. After he refuses to kill himself and his son, Itto proceeds to cut through the Yagyu guards sent to ensure that Ogami follows the order through. Instead, a deal is made between Retsudo and Itto; a quick battle to decide if Itto will live outside of the region of Edo, or die right then and there, Ogami swears vengeance on the Yagyu clan and thus takes his son into Meifumado (Hell). Becoming an assassin and leaving his official samurai life behind, Itto can strike back at his most hated foes and eventually bring down the clan who murdered his wife and ruined his House.\n\nFor 500 gold pieces and the condition that every aspect of why the employer wants the assassination done, Itto now known as Kozure Okami, sets about bringing his own brand of justice to the realm, all the while teaching Daigoro what it means to be samurai. And what a journey it is. Pushing his son around Japan in a souped up wooden, metal and bamboo baby cart, it's a strange and loving testament between father and son.\n\nThere is little autobiographical data on Itto save for the following: He claimed he was from the Sakushu region of Japan, has served the Shogun for 27 years, and is a master of \"suemono giri\" (cutting through stationery objects). Another note: his name might not really be a name but the title \"sacred sword\" which almost sounds like a translation of his name.\n\n(Source: Ninjadojo)",

She and Okina had a strong bond, though in Misao's mind, Aoshi remained the best. She also had a special affection for Han'nya, who was always the one to take care of her and taught her how to fight. When she heard that Aoshi was in Tokyo, she went to search for him and runs into Himura Kenshin on the way back to Kyoto.",

Just as Kouji arrives however, the cabin explodes. Searching the remains, he uncovers a hidden doorway into the mountain and inside, he finds his dying grandfather who tells him with his dying wish to pilot \"Mazinger Z\" and stop a man named Dr. Hell.\n\nKouji continues into the hidden lab and discovers the huge, humanoid robot Mazinger Z, and the hover pilder which is used to control it. Honoring his grandfather's last wish, he joins up with the Photon Power Labs and fights the forces of Dr. Hell with his Mazinger Z.\n\nGrendizer\nA supporting character, primarily acting as back up for Duke Fleed, the series protagonist. He enters the war against the Vegan Empire with Duke Fleed and his allies. He initially pilots the TFO, a small recon unit with minimal battle capacity. Later, he fights more directly alongside Duke with the Double Spazer, a jet-like machine with greater firepower that attaches itself to Grendizer and grants it flight capability ala the Scrander.\n\nHis personality is reminiscent of how he is portrayed in the original Mazinger Z anime. He is stubborn, hot blooded, direct, and confrontational. However, he has matured a bit, as was evident in Great Mazinger. He is still likely to be the first to charge into battle, but is more open to reason now.\n\nShin Mazinger\nThe protagonist of the series. Kouji lives with his younger brother Shiro and his grandfather Juuzo in their manor in Atami. Though his grandfather caused the accident that apparently killed his parents, Kouji feels no ill-will towards him and in fact holds him in high regard, attacking anyone who dares insults his grandfather.\n\nDuring the Ashura Corps first attack on Atami, Juuzo sends out the hover pilder to Kouji and tells him to use it to quickly fly home. Just as he reaches the manor, it is utterly obliterated as Juuzo sends out his life's work from his underground lab, the super robot Mazinger Z. After docking the pilder with Mazinger's head, Juuzo tells Kouji that with Mazinger, he has the power to do anything he wants with the world—he could even become a god or the devil. As the ultimate penance for accidentally killing his parents, Juuzo will make his grandson superhuman. Having been granted this new-found power, Kouji decides that he will use it to fight the Kabuto family's long-time enemy—Dr. Hell—and his army of mechanical beasts.",

Despite a polished and loving manner, she is actually counterproductive socially and quite bloodthirsty at times.\n\nFor most of her first 17 years of life, Chitose has been hospitalized for an incurable illness. Having no friends, she would stay in her room at all times watching through the window healthier people play outside and counting the leaves on a nearby tree. As an attempt to cheer her up, the Angels paid her a visit, during which she collapsed and asked to be one of the Angels before she dies. Her request was granted.\n\nOnce among their ranks, however, Chitose&rsquo;s tactlessness failed her attempts to make friends and led to her being shunned by most of the Angels. Feeling rejected, she vowed to destroy the Angels and joined the rival Galaxy Twin-Stars as part of her vengeful plan. Thus begun a one-sided antagonism between Chitose and the Angels, as Milfeulle still considers her to be a very good friend and the others having either forgotten who she was or became indifferent. She would later be reassigned back to the Angels and would try to be their friend again as well as destroy them.\n\nAlthough generally a nice and sweet girl, Chitose vacillates between wanting to make friends with the Angels and wanting to kill them. Fortunately, her desire for revenge is hampered by ineptitude and what seems to be bad luck, often inflicting serious harm upon herself rather than others. Unfortunately, her ability to make friends is also mired by ineptitude and bad luck, also resulting in self-injury as well as a renewed determination to kill. In the end, she rejoins the Angels.\n\nAfter her service in both the Galaxy Angels and Galaxy Twin-Stars, Chitose stayed in the military as an accountant at age 21. Buried in paperwork, her life has (relatively) never been more miserable.\n\n\nIn the manga\nShe is the newest member of the Angel Troupe. She was found drifting in space in an escape capsule, she was the only survivor of a ship that was destroyed. Chitose also lost most of her memory when she comes out of the capsule. With the help of the angels and Takuto, she is able to slowly recover her memory. Because Takuto wants Chitose to help her regain her memory, she slowly starts to have a crush on him. The other Angels slowly become concerned of Milfieulle and Takuto's relationship, but Milfie assures them that it's no big deal because she wants Chitose's memory to return completely.\n\nHowever, in volume 2, it is revealed that Chitose has unwittingly been mind-controlled by Noa all along. Noa tries to make Chitose kidnap Prince Shiva, but Chitose regains enough of her own mind to kidnap Takuto instead.",

Because of his status and power, defeating him is Roronoa Zoro's ultimate goal. Mihawk is so strong, in fact, he is accused by some characters (and fans) of having the power of a Devil Fruit; however, nothing has stated anything but that his abilities simply come from pure skill and power.\n\nHe wields the Black Sword Yoru, the strongest sword in the world. It's an ornately decorated, man-sized (6 feet) sword shaped like a cross with a shiny black blade, curved at the end. It also seems to generate otherworldly purple streaks as it slices, as seen when he cut down Zoro and when he split Don Krieg's ship in half. He can tear pirate ships apart with a single, unseen slash of his sword, blocking bullets with a simple turn of his sword, and he can easily defend against even legendary swords with a small, inch-long knife concealed in the cross he wears around his neck.\n\nIn appearance, Mihawk wears very decorative, ornate, black-and-red clothing. His most identifiable clothing would be his wide-rimmed hat adorned with a large piece of fluff, a long, black cloak, and his cross necklace and sword. He is easily compared to the real-life pirate Bartholomew Roberts, AKA Black Bart, who also donned a crimson overcoat, a wide brimmed hat with a red feather, and a diamond cross attached to a gold chain around his neck. Mihawk travels around in a coffin-shaped raft with two green-flamed candles, a single black sail, and a single seat. The fact that he can traverse across the unforgiving oceans, as well as the Grand Line itself, in such a meager craft is yet another testament to his abilities.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

For this reason, Rika is sought out and mysteriously murdered in each arc.\n\nShe has lived for hundreds of years and she's the only one (together with Hanyuu) who is aware of the time loop, although her friends eventually become aware of their deeds in previous worlds.",

By the way, the \"self-introduction\" he always does before a fight (soaring male's spirit and so on...) is Hirato's idea. It is essential that every person who applies for a fighter position submits one personally, but since Yogi himself hadn't thought about it until the application period came, he left it to his superior Hirato, who with a gentle, smiling face submitted some outrageous things. But it is well received by the Children, so he quite likes it now. Yogi comes from a small, remote country. He apparently has a younger sister.\n\nThe \"yo\" in Yogi's name means \"participate in, give, award, impart, provide, cause\" and \"gi\" is \"ceremony, rule, affair, case, a matter.\"\n(Source: extra pages from chapter 18)\n\nCircus Second Ship's Fighter.

Battles make him nervous, so he's relieved when he doesn't have to fight. His weapons are two thorn-like épées and the name of his special attack is Dornkiste (German for \"thorn chest\").\n\nLater is revealed that Yogi was the prince from a small country.\nIn chapter 61 it is shown that Yogi's closest person to him was his little sister who was killed by Varuga, and in the same chapter is also revealed that sometimes Yogi develops a split personality called \"Silver Yogi.\" His other self with silvered hair, is quite playful, powerful and if necessary will kill with no hesitation. It is hinted that this comes from a past trauma and the experiments he suffered being fused with Varuga, as it is hinted in chapter 62 that his family and everyone in his whole hometown were killed in front of him and he was probably the sole survivor. Right after the tragedy little Yogi went berserk and his unstable powers drew the attention of Circus. Tsukitachi and Hirato were sent to investigate and found Yogi crying, completely out of control. Hirato attempted to kill him but gave up when little Yogi offered no resistance and decided to save him instead. Yogi uses a small patch in his face to stop him from changing into \"Silver Yogi.\" Also, unlike Yogi, \"Silver Yogi\" remembers his tragic past.",

Born in Eiyou, the capital of Konan, Nuriko possesses superhuman strength and is later granted a pair of bracelets that transform into strength-increasing armbands by Taiitsukun. He is 18 years old. His true name is Ryuuen Chou, based on the star Willow.\n\nWhile prone to jealousy, quick to anger, and possessing a calculating tendency, Nuriko is very level-headed and compassionate and shows the most concern regarding Miaka and Tamahome's relationship. As a \"woman,\" Nuriko is infatuated with his fellow warrior, Hotohori, but as a man, he also loves Miaka Yuuki. While initially jealous of Hotohori's love for Miaka, Nuriko and Miaka become close friends. After Nuriko comes to terms with the fact that his cross-dressing resulted from the unyielding pain of losing his sister Kourin, he concludes that he had been trying to live his life as Kourin would have, not as he would have. This revelation allows him to finally allow himself to experience life as a man. He cuts his hair, which once hung down to his waist in a braid, and admits to Tamahome that he loves Miaka as more than a friend. While he maintains his feelings for Hotohori, Nuriko eventually chooses to stop dressing as a woman in order to better protect Miaka. \n\nThroughout the rest of the series, even after his death from Ashitare, one of the Seiryuu-seishi, the friendship between Nuriko and Miaka remains strong. Nuriko is the first of the seven Suzaku warriors to die.\n\nIn Fushigi Yuugi Eikoden, Nuriko was \"reborn\" at a local marketplace as a young girl named Ko Keishun. She also steals the magic ball Tasuki has, and breaks it. Despite the young girl's size, she is able to lift a heavy rock much like Nuriko, revealing that she is indeed Nuriko's reincarnation.\n\nIn the last few episodes before he died, he revealed that he fell in love with Miaka.\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

        "desc": "Ittou Ogami (拝 一刀)\nOgami Itto seemed to have a very cushy life during Edo-Era Japan, for he had been the Shogun's official executioner (Kogi Kaishakunin). A position so powerful, the term \"Second\" meant that Itto was only second to the Shogun as far as metering out death to unloyal feudal lords throughout the 60 regions of Shogunate controlled Japan. In fact, the Shogun's symbol of the Hollyhock crest was a noticeable part of Ogami's court attire, thus deeming his stature as indeed being the Shogun's final say over his people. The Kogi Kaishakunin was highest of the three positions given to certain clans of samurai under the Shogun to root out corruption amongst the feudal lords who answered to his Highness about the land. The second clan was the Yagyu who assassinated anyone caught doing treasonous deeds. The third clan was the Kurokawa. Shinobi (ninja) sent to spy on daimyos (lords) and report back to the Shogunate.\n\nOgami won his exulted position, by protecting his Highness during the contest to choose the Executioner. The opponent, Gunbei Yagyu, disarmed Itto but blatantly pointed the tip of his sword at the Shogun in his victory over Itto. Ogami seeing this as a direct threat to his Highness stepped in between the sword and the Shogun and thus won the slot of Kogi Kaishakunin. This did not bode well with the ancient patriarch of the Yagyu, Lord Retsudo. Angered that his son lost on a technicality, he plotted against Itto and eventually set off the events that would transform the Shogun's executioner into the assassin known as Kozure Okami (Lone Wolf and Cub).\n\nReturning home from work one evening, Itto finds his pregant wife Azami more fragile than she should be. It seems Lady Ogami has been suffering from terrible nightmares as of late, that the men Itto put to death were cursing the Ogami line. Ogami comforts his wife by explaining if the child they were expecting was a boy, why he chose the name Daigoro. Sadly, Azami's premonition comes true as she is murdered the next day. To further destroy Itto politically and literally, a death tablet bearing the emblem of the Hollyhock crest is placed in the shine he built to pray for the people he was required to execute.\n\nAnd this is where things fall apart, finding his wife dead (and Daigoro cut out of his mother's womb), Itto is devastated. The next morning, the chief inspector of the region (a Yagyu named Bizen), reveals to Itto that he is being tried for treason again his Highness, because of the blasphemous memorial tablet rumored to be in the Ogami memorial shrine. Itto-completely perplexed by such an accusation-agrees to let Bizen investigate the rumor, only to find that there is such a tablet in the shrine!\n\nWhile Bizen expects Itto to accept his fate of seppuku and slay both himself and his newborn son, Ogami soon smells a rat and realizes that the Ura Yagyu (the shadow Yagyu clan led by Retsudo) are behind this plot to undo him. After he refuses to kill himself and his son, Itto proceeds to cut through the Yagyu guards sent to ensure that Ogami follows the order through. Instead, a deal is made between Retsudo and Itto; a quick battle to decide if Itto will live outside of the region of Edo, or die right then and there, Ogami swears vengeance on the Yagyu clan and thus takes his son into Meifumado (Hell). Becoming an assassin and leaving his official samurai life behind, Itto can strike back at his most hated foes and eventually bring down the clan who murdered his wife and ruined his House.\n\nFor 500 gold pieces and the condition that every aspect of why the employer wants the assassination done, Itto now known as Kozure Okami, sets about bringing his own brand of justice to the realm, all the while teaching Daigoro what it means to be samurai. And what a journey it is. Pushing his son around Japan in a souped up wooden, metal and bamboo baby cart, it's a strange and loving testament between father and son.\n\nThere is little autobiographical data on Itto save for the following: He claimed he was from the Sakushu region of Japan, has served the Shogun for 27 years, and is a master of \"suemono giri\" (cutting through stationery objects). Another note: his name might not really be a name but the title \"sacred sword\" which almost sounds like a translation of his name.\n\n(Source: Ninjadojo)",

You can easily tell when he switches between either personality by his expressions. He is very kind looking at one point with his different colored hair down, but when fighting his eyes become evil-looking, veins protrude from his face, making him look like a monster, and his different colored hair sticks up completely. He spent his entire life prior to becoming an Exorcist in a castle and was shunned by the surrounding villagers, who believed he was a vampire because he attacked certain villagers, the way he had attacked them and the fact that he has the stereotypical vampire theme. This is because his teeth were made of Innocence and he was instinctively attacking Akuma, but the villagers did not know that (and, before meeting Allen and Lavi, neither did he). Later, he fell in love with Eliade, not knowing that she was an Akuma. Allen and Lavi (who enjoys teasing Krory in a fight by calling him \"Kro-chan\", or \"Krokins\") later come and recruit him to be an exorcist. He is still getting used to the \"outside world.\"\n\nArystar's Innocence, still unnamed, resides in his teeth, but the strength is in his blood. It grants him a Feral-type ability. When invoked, it gives him great strength, and the ability to drink the blood of akuma, which can allow himself to regenerate and gives him a temporary increase in strength. He is also capable of draining the akuma poison from another person before it can take full effect. However, he is not immune to Akuma poison. Krory's Innocence and body simply break it down (when his body is too weak however, his body cannot fully break down the poison). Krory is also able to remove it from another person by drinking their blood. He can also inoculate his blood on the Akuma, poisoning them and killing them in very few seconds, but this, apparently, weakens him greatly. Taking the commentary of Miranda about the crimson snow that Arystar produced, he named this ability as \"Crimson\". Arystar is also capable of wrapping blood around his hands to fortify the flesh beneath; this is because his Innocence allows him to manipulate the blood in his body and, to an extent, others' bodies. He can even detach the blood from his body to make it nigh invulnerable and wield his max strength remotely as a winged blood mannequin called \"Bloody Krory\"; It appears that after the usage of this technique he becomes exhausted, much like the blood inoculation.",

He is one of the bronze saint's most trusted allies, and serves as the man who repairs damaged cloths in the early stages of the series.\n\nMu was introduced by Masami Kurumada in vol. 3 of his manga.\n\nUnder the tutelage of Shion, the Pope of the Sanctuary, Mu was able to become the Gold Saint of Aries at a young age. While all gold saints have a base of psychic powers to some degree, Mu has been stated to possess the strongest raw psychic talent among all living gold saints. This allows him to manipulate his gift to various degrees: psychokinesis, telepathy, teleportation, and various other powers are at his command.\n\nMu is very soft spoken, with a scholarly-like personality; his demeanor is very tranquil and logical, almost as if he is a professor of the Sanctuary. Various official translations of the manga and anime, as well as Mandarin language Saint Seiya fans, tend to refer to the character as 'Lord Mu' or 'Mister Mu'. He is good friends with Taurus Aldebaran, and is very respectful to the 243 yr old master Libra Dohko.\n\nBefore the start of the series, Mu removed himself from Sanctuary after suspecting that his mentor (and then-Pope), Aries Shion, had been quietly assassinated. He relocated to Jamir, a mystical land that only those with a high level of either psychic or Cosmo power can enter. From here, Mu severed all ties to Sanctuary and lived a life of solitude with his apprentice, the young psychic Kiki. It wasn't until years later, when he met Dragon Shiryu and Pegasus Seiya, that he began to become involved in the affairs of Sanctuary again.\n\nThroughout the manga and anime series, Mu is the man to go to when a Saint needs his or her cloth repaired. Although every individual Cloth has the ability to regenerate itself after a battle, a hands-on restoration from Mu is needed if a cloth has been severely damaged to the point of death. In normal cases, 1/3 of a person's total blood supply is required for Mu to begin work right away. When restoring an armor, Mu uses hardware tools and the elements that are used to forge a Cloth: the mythical and extremely rare metal known as Gammanium, used in an alloy with the legendary metal Orichalcum, and finally, the radiant Star Dust Sand.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Despite looking as if she is in her early teens, Road is referred to as the oldest of the Noah. Road has an affinity for candies and blood, as well as a childlike enjoyment of birthday-reminiscent themes.\n\nRoad has a plethora of supernatural abilities, ranging from the ability to travel to an alternate dimension through a door that appears at her will to complete regeneration after injury. Her dimensional space is in the form of a wrapped present, while her weapons of choice are levitating candles that can be sharpened to waxen stakes. While inside her personal dimension, she can control nonliving objects within the area; For instance, her stake-like candles fly to attack at her will. She has absolute control of everything in her dimension ranging from her appearing out of the floor, creating a copy of Lavi to crumbling his Innocence. Outside of her dimension she has displayed Telekinetic powers.\n\nRoad's personality and home life are surprisingly normal, despite her role as a villain. She has a childlike need to be entertained at all times, usually by the Earl's parasol Lero, and forces Tyki to entertain her when Lero will not. She shows a tendency to procrastinate on schoolwork, like many children her age, and appears to be in trouble for skipping classes often. Despite her childlike tendencies, she has also shown signs of extreme sadism and seems to enjoy watching the suffering of others, including stabbing Allen through the eye, killing an Akuma subordinate for no other reason then to anger Allen, and nailing Miranda’s hands to a clock while writing profanity on the wall in her blood.\n\nHer relationships with the other members of the Noah family all vary on a basis quite similar to a normal family situation; She looks up to Tyki as an older brother and is very close to him, while the twins appear to bicker with her often in a sibling-like, affectionate manner. Her relationship with Skin is unknown, as almost no interaction between the two is shown in the series. She also seems to have feelings for Allen Walker, as she kisses him upon seeing him again. Tyki finds this surprising, as the only one she kissed before was the Earl.\n\nDespite Road's young appearance, she is considered the First Child by Debit and Jasdero, which suggests that she was the first Noah to awaken in the current generation. Due to this fact, she is the only Noah capable of programming Noah's Ark, and appears to have the favoritism of the Millennium Earl. She represents Noah's \"Dreams\".

He has a tremendous amount of pride and cares deeply for his country and the people around him. He is also an extremely talented cook. Despite his smart and calculating exterior, Asch has moments of incredible goofiness. At one point he masquerades as Luke and is asked (by someone who had met Luke a few days previously) how his hair had changed from short to long in such a short time. Asch's improvised excuse was, \"My hair grows fast.\" \n\nMost of what Asch does is the \"behind the scenes\" work - though works towards the same goal as Luke and friends. However, most of the time, he outright refuses to work with them. At the end of the game, he even fought Luke over who would fight Van. \n\nAsch openly despises Luke as the person who replaced him. He hates how Luke considers himself (as the clone) to be the inferior one, as not only is he a copy of Asch (and Asch has a tremendous amount of pride) but he was the one who essentially usurped Asch's life with no effort whatsoever. He also considers them rivals in swordsmanship as they are both pupils of Van. \n\nAlthough he thinks that Luke is supposed to be his replacement, and thus the same as him, there are many things in the game that say otherwise. Perhaps the most obvious of these is that Luke's hair is light at the ends, and Asch's is darker. Their clothing is also like this, with Luke's white and gold contrasting with Asch's black and silver. Yet another difference between them is that Luke is left handed, and Asch is right handed. Also, as Luke gradually changes throughout the game, Asch always stays the same. \n\nLuke and Asch fought (due to Asch's stubbornness) at the end of the game to settle the issue over who the \"real\" Luke was. In the end, Luke did win, yet Asch still thought of Luke as his replica. One of his last actions was to take his name back as his own, as a small step in accepting Luke, and acknowledging that he wasn't inferior. \n\nUpon his death, he gave Luke some of his power, allowing Luke to use second-order hyperresonance (and to fully control it at that). It gave Luke the power he needed to finally defeat Sync and Van. \n(Source: Aselia - The Tales Wiki)",

Ritsu has shoulder-length, brown hair, with her bangs pulled back with a yellow hairband, and gold-colored eyes. She wears her school jacket open.

You can easily tell when he switches between either personality by his expressions. He is very kind looking at one point with his different colored hair down, but when fighting his eyes become evil-looking, veins protrude from his face, making him look like a monster, and his different colored hair sticks up completely. He spent his entire life prior to becoming an Exorcist in a castle and was shunned by the surrounding villagers, who believed he was a vampire because he attacked certain villagers, the way he had attacked them and the fact that he has the stereotypical vampire theme. This is because his teeth were made of Innocence and he was instinctively attacking Akuma, but the villagers did not know that (and, before meeting Allen and Lavi, neither did he). Later, he fell in love with Eliade, not knowing that she was an Akuma. Allen and Lavi (who enjoys teasing Krory in a fight by calling him \"Kro-chan\", or \"Krokins\") later come and recruit him to be an exorcist. He is still getting used to the \"outside world.\"\n\nArystar's Innocence, still unnamed, resides in his teeth, but the strength is in his blood. It grants him a Feral-type ability. When invoked, it gives him great strength, and the ability to drink the blood of akuma, which can allow himself to regenerate and gives him a temporary increase in strength. He is also capable of draining the akuma poison from another person before it can take full effect. However, he is not immune to Akuma poison. Krory's Innocence and body simply break it down (when his body is too weak however, his body cannot fully break down the poison). Krory is also able to remove it from another person by drinking their blood. He can also inoculate his blood on the Akuma, poisoning them and killing them in very few seconds, but this, apparently, weakens him greatly. Taking the commentary of Miranda about the crimson snow that Arystar produced, he named this ability as \"Crimson\". Arystar is also capable of wrapping blood around his hands to fortify the flesh beneath; this is because his Innocence allows him to manipulate the blood in his body and, to an extent, others' bodies. He can even detach the blood from his body to make it nigh invulnerable and wield his max strength remotely as a winged blood mannequin called \"Bloody Krory\"; It appears that after the usage of this technique he becomes exhausted, much like the blood inoculation.",

And also because the technique costs lots of energy even from the original user, Kise can only use them for 5 minutes during a match.",

He has a tremendous amount of pride and cares deeply for his country and the people around him. He is also an extremely talented cook. Despite his smart and calculating exterior, Asch has moments of incredible goofiness. At one point he masquerades as Luke and is asked (by someone who had met Luke a few days previously) how his hair had changed from short to long in such a short time. Asch's improvised excuse was, \"My hair grows fast.\" \n\nMost of what Asch does is the \"behind the scenes\" work - though works towards the same goal as Luke and friends. However, most of the time, he outright refuses to work with them. At the end of the game, he even fought Luke over who would fight Van. \n\nAsch openly despises Luke as the person who replaced him. He hates how Luke considers himself (as the clone) to be the inferior one, as not only is he a copy of Asch (and Asch has a tremendous amount of pride) but he was the one who essentially usurped Asch's life with no effort whatsoever. He also considers them rivals in swordsmanship as they are both pupils of Van. \n\nAlthough he thinks that Luke is supposed to be his replacement, and thus the same as him, there are many things in the game that say otherwise. Perhaps the most obvious of these is that Luke's hair is light at the ends, and Asch's is darker. Their clothing is also like this, with Luke's white and gold contrasting with Asch's black and silver. Yet another difference between them is that Luke is left handed, and Asch is right handed. Also, as Luke gradually changes throughout the game, Asch always stays the same. \n\nLuke and Asch fought (due to Asch's stubbornness) at the end of the game to settle the issue over who the \"real\" Luke was. In the end, Luke did win, yet Asch still thought of Luke as his replica. One of his last actions was to take his name back as his own, as a small step in accepting Luke, and acknowledging that he wasn't inferior. \n\nUpon his death, he gave Luke some of his power, allowing Luke to use second-order hyperresonance (and to fully control it at that). It gave Luke the power he needed to finally defeat Sync and Van. \n(Source: Aselia - The Tales Wiki)",

He is one of the bronze saint's most trusted allies, and serves as the man who repairs damaged cloths in the early stages of the series.\n\nMu was introduced by Masami Kurumada in vol. 3 of his manga.\n\nUnder the tutelage of Shion, the Pope of the Sanctuary, Mu was able to become the Gold Saint of Aries at a young age. While all gold saints have a base of psychic powers to some degree, Mu has been stated to possess the strongest raw psychic talent among all living gold saints. This allows him to manipulate his gift to various degrees: psychokinesis, telepathy, teleportation, and various other powers are at his command.\n\nMu is very soft spoken, with a scholarly-like personality; his demeanor is very tranquil and logical, almost as if he is a professor of the Sanctuary. Various official translations of the manga and anime, as well as Mandarin language Saint Seiya fans, tend to refer to the character as 'Lord Mu' or 'Mister Mu'. He is good friends with Taurus Aldebaran, and is very respectful to the 243 yr old master Libra Dohko.\n\nBefore the start of the series, Mu removed himself from Sanctuary after suspecting that his mentor (and then-Pope), Aries Shion, had been quietly assassinated. He relocated to Jamir, a mystical land that only those with a high level of either psychic or Cosmo power can enter. From here, Mu severed all ties to Sanctuary and lived a life of solitude with his apprentice, the young psychic Kiki. It wasn't until years later, when he met Dragon Shiryu and Pegasus Seiya, that he began to become involved in the affairs of Sanctuary again.\n\nThroughout the manga and anime series, Mu is the man to go to when a Saint needs his or her cloth repaired. Although every individual Cloth has the ability to regenerate itself after a battle, a hands-on restoration from Mu is needed if a cloth has been severely damaged to the point of death. In normal cases, 1/3 of a person's total blood supply is required for Mu to begin work right away. When restoring an armor, Mu uses hardware tools and the elements that are used to forge a Cloth: the mythical and extremely rare metal known as Gammanium, used in an alloy with the legendary metal Orichalcum, and finally, the radiant Star Dust Sand.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

        "desc": "Nuriko  (柳宿; 迢 柳娟)\nNuriko first appears disguised as \"Kourin\" in Emperor Hotohori's harem, which Hotohori never visits except to welcome new maidens. \"Kourin\" was in fact Nuriko's younger sister, who died at a young age; he began behaving and dressing like her to keep her memory alive. Born in Eiyou, the capital of Konan, Nuriko possesses superhuman strength and is later granted a pair of bracelets that transform into strength-increasing armbands by Taiitsukun. He is 18 years old. His true name is Ryuuen Chou, based on the star Willow.\n\nWhile prone to jealousy, quick to anger, and possessing a calculating tendency, Nuriko is very level-headed and compassionate and shows the most concern regarding Miaka and Tamahome's relationship. As a \"woman,\" Nuriko is infatuated with his fellow warrior, Hotohori, but as a man, he also loves Miaka Yuuki. While initially jealous of Hotohori's love for Miaka, Nuriko and Miaka become close friends. After Nuriko comes to terms with the fact that his cross-dressing resulted from the unyielding pain of losing his sister Kourin, he concludes that he had been trying to live his life as Kourin would have, not as he would have. This revelation allows him to finally allow himself to experience life as a man. He cuts his hair, which once hung down to his waist in a braid, and admits to Tamahome that he loves Miaka as more than a friend. While he maintains his feelings for Hotohori, Nuriko eventually chooses to stop dressing as a woman in order to better protect Miaka. \n\nThroughout the rest of the series, even after his death from Ashitare, one of the Seiryuu-seishi, the friendship between Nuriko and Miaka remains strong. Nuriko is the first of the seven Suzaku warriors to die.\n\nIn Fushigi Yuugi Eikoden, Nuriko was \"reborn\" at a local marketplace as a young girl named Ko Keishun. She also steals the magic ball Tasuki has, and breaks it. Despite the young girl's size, she is able to lift a heavy rock much like Nuriko, revealing that she is indeed Nuriko's reincarnation.\n\nIn the last few episodes before he died, he revealed that he fell in love with Miaka.\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Athough apparently he's not bad in German either.\n\nLen is a surly, quiet and rather cold violinist who normally behaves contemptuously toward and around everyone. He was a child prodigy, coming from a family of renowned musicians. His mother, Misa Hamai, is a very famous pianist and his father is a well-known violinist. Because of this, many people take his brilliance for granted. He seems very cold towards those that he comes into contact with, even his admirers, to whom he rarely pays any attention.\nBefore he met Kahoko he didn't believe music was enjoyable, though after spending time with her, Len slowly began to enjoy music and his music changes because of her. He slowly warms up to Hino and even gives her advice on how to hold and stand properly with the violin. People think that he acts harshly towards Hino, but deep down in his heart he is really concerned about her (though he may not show it). As the series progresses, he realizes his feelings for her. He's slowly affected by Hino and his mother says that he has changed his character. His mother knows that Hino is the one that affected him or changed his personality. He can also play the piano as well, which may be due to the influence of his famous pianist mother, Misa Hamai. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nAt the end of the manga, he confessed to Hino, they both hugged, Lili hoping for the two to kiss, thus, violin romance occured again.

Medaka attempted to reform him, like she had done to her other classmates, but Kumagawa proved to be beyond her influence.

As stated by Medaka, he actually does care for his comrades.\n\nLater he traded \"All Fiction\" for his original minus, \"Book Maker\", which allows him to turn the target into a minus. This was proven in his battle against Medaka. After he admitted his own defeat, Kumagawa was given the Student Council Vice-president position by Medaka, which in turn, made him the final member of the Student Council.\nTen years later, Kumagawa's whereabouts are unknown. His message to Medaka from the 100 Flowers Run is revealed to be that he had fun the past four years.\n(Source: Medaka Box Wikia)",

        "desc": "Tyki Mikk (ティキ・ミック)\nShortly after Allen meets Arystar and recruits him into becoming an ally, he met Tyki. The man lives a double life: his \"white side\" that is a carefree and goofy man of Portuguese descent who travels with humans that love to play poker, and his sadistic \"dark side\" that has a lust for blood and takes up his role as Noah's descendant (and therefore, one of the antagonists).\n\nTyki and his group suckers Arystar into a game of strip poker, winning literally all his assets, but Allen interferes and plays against them. He wins (with cheating learned from years spent with Cross), and Tyki gives him a pack of playing cards before his group departs.\n\nThe author gives the first hint that something is wrong when the group is revealed to have in their possession a chunk of silver with the name Kevin Yeegar on it - the name of the exorcist general that had recently been killed. In their next encounter, Allen meets Tyki's Noah side, and, after a talk, Tyki leaves him to die from a heart wound inflicted by Tease (a flesh-eating type of golem in the form of a butterfly) after destroying his Innocence, spreading out the same cards he had given Allen over the boy's body. After realizing that Allen's name would not come off the walls of the jail cell, he goes with Jasdero and Debit to find Cross.\n\nTyki's powers stem from his ability to selectively interact with his surroundings. This allows him to become effectively intangible, passing through all manner of matter as a ghost would, or walk on air.\n\nHis powers also have an offensive aspect, allowing him to phase his hand into his opponents' bodies and selectively interact with their organs (i.e. heart), crushing them or tearing them out without leaving any external wounds.\nHe also possesses the ability to reject the existence of space around an area he chooses, which essentially makes it possible for him to create a vacuum around anything he pleases (this ability was put to good effect against Allen, which allowed Tyki to suffocate him in their fight).\n\nHe usually attacks using his powers in concert with the flesh-eating Tease golems given to him by the Earl of Millennium. The Tease themselves are capable of multiplying themselves, becoming a large swarm to consume Tyki's enemies, or change shape to act as shields or throwing blades.\nHe was responsible for the death of Kevin Yeegar, one of the 5 exorcist generals, and has killed over 6 other exorcists himself, including Suman Dark (whom Allen had tried to save), Tina Spark, Gwen Frere, Sol Galen, Kazanna Reed, Chakar Rabon, and Daisya Barry.",

His bounty before he became a member of the Shichibukai was 340,000,000 Beli.\n\nDoflamingo is a larger than normal blond haired man who generally dresses in flamboyant clothes. In reference to his animal theme, the flamingo, his clothes are brightly colored with his feathered coat being distinctively pink. He also has an odd way of walking, a bow-legged waddle (but does not always do this), which is also a reference to his animal theme. Twenty-two years ago, his hair was longer than currently, had two earrings in his left ear, and he sported a pair of goggles that he wore on his forehead, in addition to his sunglasses that he wears to this day.\n\nHe has a white shirt with red stripes, a green belt, and orange pants with white stripes. Originally in the anime, Doflamingo had a red shirt with black stripes, a purple belt, and black pants with red stripes. However, when he reappeared during the events of Sabaody, his color scheme was switched to its manga depiction with the exception of his glasses. In the manga, he has orange tinted glasses while in the anime, he has purple tinted ones. He is also often, if not always, smiling.\n\nDoflamingo is one of the most carefree characters in One Piece. He seems to have a penchant for dramatic phrasing, as well as a habit of exaggerated posing when giving declarations. He also appears to fear nothing and no one, as he openly taunts Fleet Admiral Sengoku, sits on the table during the Shichibukai meeting and shows only gleeful interest at the thought of warring with Whitebeard. During the Battle of Marineford, all of Doflamingo's interactions have all been for the sake of personal amusement, hinting a sadistic side. He also has an odd habit of sitting in odd positions, like on the back of chairs, on tables, barrels and, even a pile of bodies in the middle of a war zone.\n\nAlthough Doflamingo appeared in the first half of the series frequently, he did not play much of a role until the second half. He is the main antagonist of the Dressrosa Arc and one of the central antagonists of the Pirate Alliance Saga. He is revealed to be an underworld broker, where he operates under the alias \"Joker,\" and during the Dressrosa Arc, it is revealed that he was formerly a World Noble.\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He, along with Kimura Tatsuya, are known to have been scouted into boxing by Takamura Mamoru, an individual they swore to defeat but eventually came to admire.\n\nAoki was a punk from his childhood up through high school, at which point he encountered, fought and got beat down by Takamura Mamoru (who was then a middleweight with two wins under his belt). This loss motivated him to quit school along with his close friend Kimura Tetsuya to become boxers at Kamogawa gym. Although their initial goal was to land a clean hit on Takamura, they grew to love boxing and develop their own skills. Aoki became a clownish boxer whose signature techniques, the Frog Punch and Look-Away, eventually led him to a draw in a Japanese title match with then-champion Imae Katsuka. Currently in the series, Aoki had a going rivalry with Papaya Dachiu, the lightweight champion of the Philippnes, with whom he has drawn two consecutive matches.\n\nIn a flashback shown in the series, Aoki is known for his troubled school life as a delinquent. He, along with long-time friend Kimura, were known to participate in countless fights and brawls with 'rival' schools. Throughout the series Aoki has shown a rather playful, immature, and mischievous personality- an attitude he reflects in his boxing matches where (due to his comparatively unexceptional boxing skills) he constantly thinks of methods to to deceive, confuse, or even ridicule opponents to a certain extent. A very long-running gag is that Aoki keeps revealing impressing talents, that sadly have no connection with boxing. Another one involves his girlfriend's friendship with Kumi that has made made contacting her far more easy than Ippo could ever hope, so Aoki often helps him out. His prankster personality extends to his own teammates and is most notably reflected in his attitude towards Makunouchi Ippo and (at times) Takamura Mamoru. Together with Kimura he is paired into the Aokimura duo by Itagaki Manabu.\n\nAoki's taste in women is seen as a running joke in the Hajime no Ippo series where, in contrast to the tastes of his gym mates, Aoki places his preferences in women considered 'ugly' by everyone else. This may be due to an incident where he was cruelly dumped by a beautiful girl, psychologically turning him to prefer uglier girls. Even though he may have a taste for \"ugly\" girls, he is able to hold a girlfriend, Tomiko, longer then any of the other guys with the exception of Ippo but it remains to be seen if he and Kumi will ultimately be together.\n\nFor the most part Aoki's fights in the series are not as major or impactive on the general storyline. However, in his most recent fight against Iga Shinobu (and his coach Kurita Baron, a former member of the Kamogawa Gym), Aoki was beaten badly and landed himself in the hospital. Given the option to retire with Kimura after their considerably lengthy careers Aoki refuses, and is determined then to stay in the lightweight class until he defeats Iga, whom he now considers his goal and rival. Takamura is then seen commenting on how stubborn both Aoki and Kimura are.\nCurrent Record\nRank5 (JBC)\nTotal fights: 23\nWins: 12\nWins by ko: 7\nLosses: 8\nDraws: 3",

        "desc": "Ittou Ogami (拝 一刀)\nOgami Itto seemed to have a very cushy life during Edo-Era Japan, for he had been the Shogun's official executioner (Kogi Kaishakunin). A position so powerful, the term \"Second\" meant that Itto was only second to the Shogun as far as metering out death to unloyal feudal lords throughout the 60 regions of Shogunate controlled Japan. In fact, the Shogun's symbol of the Hollyhock crest was a noticeable part of Ogami's court attire, thus deeming his stature as indeed being the Shogun's final say over his people. The Kogi Kaishakunin was highest of the three positions given to certain clans of samurai under the Shogun to root out corruption amongst the feudal lords who answered to his Highness about the land. The second clan was the Yagyu who assassinated anyone caught doing treasonous deeds. The third clan was the Kurokawa. Shinobi (ninja) sent to spy on daimyos (lords) and report back to the Shogunate.\n\nOgami won his exulted position, by protecting his Highness during the contest to choose the Executioner. The opponent, Gunbei Yagyu, disarmed Itto but blatantly pointed the tip of his sword at the Shogun in his victory over Itto. Ogami seeing this as a direct threat to his Highness stepped in between the sword and the Shogun and thus won the slot of Kogi Kaishakunin. This did not bode well with the ancient patriarch of the Yagyu, Lord Retsudo. Angered that his son lost on a technicality, he plotted against Itto and eventually set off the events that would transform the Shogun's executioner into the assassin known as Kozure Okami (Lone Wolf and Cub).\n\nReturning home from work one evening, Itto finds his pregant wife Azami more fragile than she should be. It seems Lady Ogami has been suffering from terrible nightmares as of late, that the men Itto put to death were cursing the Ogami line. Ogami comforts his wife by explaining if the child they were expecting was a boy, why he chose the name Daigoro. Sadly, Azami's premonition comes true as she is murdered the next day. To further destroy Itto politically and literally, a death tablet bearing the emblem of the Hollyhock crest is placed in the shine he built to pray for the people he was required to execute.\n\nAnd this is where things fall apart, finding his wife dead (and Daigoro cut out of his mother's womb), Itto is devastated. The next morning, the chief inspector of the region (a Yagyu named Bizen), reveals to Itto that he is being tried for treason again his Highness, because of the blasphemous memorial tablet rumored to be in the Ogami memorial shrine. Itto-completely perplexed by such an accusation-agrees to let Bizen investigate the rumor, only to find that there is such a tablet in the shrine!\n\nWhile Bizen expects Itto to accept his fate of seppuku and slay both himself and his newborn son, Ogami soon smells a rat and realizes that the Ura Yagyu (the shadow Yagyu clan led by Retsudo) are behind this plot to undo him. After he refuses to kill himself and his son, Itto proceeds to cut through the Yagyu guards sent to ensure that Ogami follows the order through. Instead, a deal is made between Retsudo and Itto; a quick battle to decide if Itto will live outside of the region of Edo, or die right then and there, Ogami swears vengeance on the Yagyu clan and thus takes his son into Meifumado (Hell). Becoming an assassin and leaving his official samurai life behind, Itto can strike back at his most hated foes and eventually bring down the clan who murdered his wife and ruined his House.\n\nFor 500 gold pieces and the condition that every aspect of why the employer wants the assassination done, Itto now known as Kozure Okami, sets about bringing his own brand of justice to the realm, all the while teaching Daigoro what it means to be samurai. And what a journey it is. Pushing his son around Japan in a souped up wooden, metal and bamboo baby cart, it's a strange and loving testament between father and son.\n\nThere is little autobiographical data on Itto save for the following: He claimed he was from the Sakushu region of Japan, has served the Shogun for 27 years, and is a master of \"suemono giri\" (cutting through stationery objects). Another note: his name might not really be a name but the title \"sacred sword\" which almost sounds like a translation of his name.\n\n(Source: Ninjadojo)",

Despite looking as if she is in her early teens, Road is referred to as the oldest of the Noah. Road has an affinity for candies and blood, as well as a childlike enjoyment of birthday-reminiscent themes.\n\nRoad has a plethora of supernatural abilities, ranging from the ability to travel to an alternate dimension through a door that appears at her will to complete regeneration after injury. Her dimensional space is in the form of a wrapped present, while her weapons of choice are levitating candles that can be sharpened to waxen stakes. While inside her personal dimension, she can control nonliving objects within the area; For instance, her stake-like candles fly to attack at her will. She has absolute control of everything in her dimension ranging from her appearing out of the floor, creating a copy of Lavi to crumbling his Innocence. Outside of her dimension she has displayed Telekinetic powers.\n\nRoad's personality and home life are surprisingly normal, despite her role as a villain. She has a childlike need to be entertained at all times, usually by the Earl's parasol Lero, and forces Tyki to entertain her when Lero will not. She shows a tendency to procrastinate on schoolwork, like many children her age, and appears to be in trouble for skipping classes often. Despite her childlike tendencies, she has also shown signs of extreme sadism and seems to enjoy watching the suffering of others, including stabbing Allen through the eye, killing an Akuma subordinate for no other reason then to anger Allen, and nailing Miranda’s hands to a clock while writing profanity on the wall in her blood.\n\nHer relationships with the other members of the Noah family all vary on a basis quite similar to a normal family situation; She looks up to Tyki as an older brother and is very close to him, while the twins appear to bicker with her often in a sibling-like, affectionate manner. Her relationship with Skin is unknown, as almost no interaction between the two is shown in the series. She also seems to have feelings for Allen Walker, as she kisses him upon seeing him again. Tyki finds this surprising, as the only one she kissed before was the Earl.\n\nDespite Road's young appearance, she is considered the First Child by Debit and Jasdero, which suggests that she was the first Noah to awaken in the current generation. Due to this fact, she is the only Noah capable of programming Noah's Ark, and appears to have the favoritism of the Millennium Earl. She represents Noah's \"Dreams\".

You can easily tell when he switches between either personality by his expressions. He is very kind looking at one point with his different colored hair down, but when fighting his eyes become evil-looking, veins protrude from his face, making him look like a monster, and his different colored hair sticks up completely. He spent his entire life prior to becoming an Exorcist in a castle and was shunned by the surrounding villagers, who believed he was a vampire because he attacked certain villagers, the way he had attacked them and the fact that he has the stereotypical vampire theme. This is because his teeth were made of Innocence and he was instinctively attacking Akuma, but the villagers did not know that (and, before meeting Allen and Lavi, neither did he). Later, he fell in love with Eliade, not knowing that she was an Akuma. Allen and Lavi (who enjoys teasing Krory in a fight by calling him \"Kro-chan\", or \"Krokins\") later come and recruit him to be an exorcist. He is still getting used to the \"outside world.\"\n\nArystar's Innocence, still unnamed, resides in his teeth, but the strength is in his blood. It grants him a Feral-type ability. When invoked, it gives him great strength, and the ability to drink the blood of akuma, which can allow himself to regenerate and gives him a temporary increase in strength. He is also capable of draining the akuma poison from another person before it can take full effect. However, he is not immune to Akuma poison. Krory's Innocence and body simply break it down (when his body is too weak however, his body cannot fully break down the poison). Krory is also able to remove it from another person by drinking their blood. He can also inoculate his blood on the Akuma, poisoning them and killing them in very few seconds, but this, apparently, weakens him greatly. Taking the commentary of Miranda about the crimson snow that Arystar produced, he named this ability as \"Crimson\". Arystar is also capable of wrapping blood around his hands to fortify the flesh beneath; this is because his Innocence allows him to manipulate the blood in his body and, to an extent, others' bodies. He can even detach the blood from his body to make it nigh invulnerable and wield his max strength remotely as a winged blood mannequin called \"Bloody Krory\"; It appears that after the usage of this technique he becomes exhausted, much like the blood inoculation.",

He's the only disciple of the Pope and previous Cancer Gold Saint, Sage.\n\nManigoldo shares some personality traits and the look possessed by the 20th century Cancer Gold Saint (Deathmask), though he isn't evil. He was shown as being somewhat hostile and talking in an informal, almost humorous way. He also can be bold, aggressive, arrogant and very confident.\n\nIn the past, he believed that the dead of all eras are nothing but refuse. When meeting Sage, he decides to train in the Sanctuary to understand the idea that \"every person who is alive or dead is part of the universe.\"\n\nManigoldo was taught by Sage a large number of techniques related with souls. In direct relation to the oriental folklore pertaining the Cancer constellation, he has the ability to send souls to the entrance to the Underworld with his Praesepe Underworld Waves (Sekishiki Meikaiha)—base technique of Cancer Saints. Using the Praesepe Demonic Blue Flames (Sekishiki Kisoen), Manigoldo creates an orb in his hand, igniting every soul nearby, thus incinerating the souls of his opponents. He is also capable of using the Praesepe Soul Burial Waves (Sekishiki Konsoha) to stray souls nearby as gunpowder to create a great explosion. Apart from the attacks involving souls, Manigoldo can use a physical attack called Acubens in which Manigoldo uses both his legs as pincers of a crab's claw to cut his opponent in half, hence the name.\n\nDuring the series Manigoldo encounters Thanatos, a feat which proves too much and has him almost killed. With the aid of his master Sage, however, he proves to be a challenge for the god. In his last moments, Manigoldo launches a last-ditch attack against Thanatos' physical body, destroying it and in the aftermath being pulverized himself, giving Sage a chance to seal Thanatos away. After the death of Sage, the soul of Manigoldo appears in the Sanctuary and gives to Aries Shion the helmet of the Pope to give it to his teacher.\nHe last appears in spiritual form during the attack of golden light unleashed by the Gold Saints on Hades.",

The man lives a double life: his \"white side\" that is a carefree and goofy man of Portuguese descent who travels with humans that love to play poker, and his sadistic \"dark side\" that has a lust for blood and takes up his role as Noah's descendant (and therefore, one of the antagonists).\n\nTyki and his group suckers Arystar into a game of strip poker, winning literally all his assets, but Allen interferes and plays against them. He wins (with cheating learned from years spent with Cross), and Tyki gives him a pack of playing cards before his group departs.\n\nThe author gives the first hint that something is wrong when the group is revealed to have in their possession a chunk of silver with the name Kevin Yeegar on it - the name of the exorcist general that had recently been killed. In their next encounter, Allen meets Tyki's Noah side, and, after a talk, Tyki leaves him to die from a heart wound inflicted by Tease (a flesh-eating type of golem in the form of a butterfly) after destroying his Innocence, spreading out the same cards he had given Allen over the boy's body. After realizing that Allen's name would not come off the walls of the jail cell, he goes with Jasdero and Debit to find Cross.\n\nTyki's powers stem from his ability to selectively interact with his surroundings. This allows him to become effectively intangible, passing through all manner of matter as a ghost would, or walk on air.\n\nHis powers also have an offensive aspect, allowing him to phase his hand into his opponents' bodies and selectively interact with their organs (i.e. heart), crushing them or tearing them out without leaving any external wounds.\nHe also possesses the ability to reject the existence of space around an area he chooses, which essentially makes it possible for him to create a vacuum around anything he pleases (this ability was put to good effect against Allen, which allowed Tyki to suffocate him in their fight).\n\nHe usually attacks using his powers in concert with the flesh-eating Tease golems given to him by the Earl of Millennium. The Tease themselves are capable of multiplying themselves, becoming a large swarm to consume Tyki's enemies, or change shape to act as shields or throwing blades.\nHe was responsible for the death of Kevin Yeegar, one of the 5 exorcist generals, and has killed over 6 other exorcists himself, including Suman Dark (whom Allen had tried to save), Tina Spark, Gwen Frere, Sol Galen, Kazanna Reed, Chakar Rabon, and Daisya Barry.",

Athough apparently he's not bad in German either.\n\nLen is a surly, quiet and rather cold violinist who normally behaves contemptuously toward and around everyone. He was a child prodigy, coming from a family of renowned musicians. His mother, Misa Hamai, is a very famous pianist and his father is a well-known violinist. Because of this, many people take his brilliance for granted. He seems very cold towards those that he comes into contact with, even his admirers, to whom he rarely pays any attention.\nBefore he met Kahoko he didn't believe music was enjoyable, though after spending time with her, Len slowly began to enjoy music and his music changes because of her. He slowly warms up to Hino and even gives her advice on how to hold and stand properly with the violin. People think that he acts harshly towards Hino, but deep down in his heart he is really concerned about her (though he may not show it). As the series progresses, he realizes his feelings for her. He's slowly affected by Hino and his mother says that he has changed his character. His mother knows that Hino is the one that affected him or changed his personality. He can also play the piano as well, which may be due to the influence of his famous pianist mother, Misa Hamai. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nAt the end of the manga, he confessed to Hino, they both hugged, Lili hoping for the two to kiss, thus, violin romance occured again.

He, along with Kimura Tatsuya, are known to have been scouted into boxing by Takamura Mamoru, an individual they swore to defeat but eventually came to admire.\n\nAoki was a punk from his childhood up through high school, at which point he encountered, fought and got beat down by Takamura Mamoru (who was then a middleweight with two wins under his belt). This loss motivated him to quit school along with his close friend Kimura Tetsuya to become boxers at Kamogawa gym. Although their initial goal was to land a clean hit on Takamura, they grew to love boxing and develop their own skills. Aoki became a clownish boxer whose signature techniques, the Frog Punch and Look-Away, eventually led him to a draw in a Japanese title match with then-champion Imae Katsuka. Currently in the series, Aoki had a going rivalry with Papaya Dachiu, the lightweight champion of the Philippnes, with whom he has drawn two consecutive matches.\n\nIn a flashback shown in the series, Aoki is known for his troubled school life as a delinquent. He, along with long-time friend Kimura, were known to participate in countless fights and brawls with 'rival' schools. Throughout the series Aoki has shown a rather playful, immature, and mischievous personality- an attitude he reflects in his boxing matches where (due to his comparatively unexceptional boxing skills) he constantly thinks of methods to to deceive, confuse, or even ridicule opponents to a certain extent. A very long-running gag is that Aoki keeps revealing impressing talents, that sadly have no connection with boxing. Another one involves his girlfriend's friendship with Kumi that has made made contacting her far more easy than Ippo could ever hope, so Aoki often helps him out. His prankster personality extends to his own teammates and is most notably reflected in his attitude towards Makunouchi Ippo and (at times) Takamura Mamoru. Together with Kimura he is paired into the Aokimura duo by Itagaki Manabu.\n\nAoki's taste in women is seen as a running joke in the Hajime no Ippo series where, in contrast to the tastes of his gym mates, Aoki places his preferences in women considered 'ugly' by everyone else. This may be due to an incident where he was cruelly dumped by a beautiful girl, psychologically turning him to prefer uglier girls. Even though he may have a taste for \"ugly\" girls, he is able to hold a girlfriend, Tomiko, longer then any of the other guys with the exception of Ippo but it remains to be seen if he and Kumi will ultimately be together.\n\nFor the most part Aoki's fights in the series are not as major or impactive on the general storyline. However, in his most recent fight against Iga Shinobu (and his coach Kurita Baron, a former member of the Kamogawa Gym), Aoki was beaten badly and landed himself in the hospital. Given the option to retire with Kimura after their considerably lengthy careers Aoki refuses, and is determined then to stay in the lightweight class until he defeats Iga, whom he now considers his goal and rival. Takamura is then seen commenting on how stubborn both Aoki and Kimura are.\nCurrent Record\nRank5 (JBC)\nTotal fights: 23\nWins: 12\nWins by ko: 7\nLosses: 8\nDraws: 3",

        "desc": "Ittou Ogami (拝 一刀)\nOgami Itto seemed to have a very cushy life during Edo-Era Japan, for he had been the Shogun's official executioner (Kogi Kaishakunin). A position so powerful, the term \"Second\" meant that Itto was only second to the Shogun as far as metering out death to unloyal feudal lords throughout the 60 regions of Shogunate controlled Japan. In fact, the Shogun's symbol of the Hollyhock crest was a noticeable part of Ogami's court attire, thus deeming his stature as indeed being the Shogun's final say over his people. The Kogi Kaishakunin was highest of the three positions given to certain clans of samurai under the Shogun to root out corruption amongst the feudal lords who answered to his Highness about the land. The second clan was the Yagyu who assassinated anyone caught doing treasonous deeds. The third clan was the Kurokawa. Shinobi (ninja) sent to spy on daimyos (lords) and report back to the Shogunate.\n\nOgami won his exulted position, by protecting his Highness during the contest to choose the Executioner. The opponent, Gunbei Yagyu, disarmed Itto but blatantly pointed the tip of his sword at the Shogun in his victory over Itto. Ogami seeing this as a direct threat to his Highness stepped in between the sword and the Shogun and thus won the slot of Kogi Kaishakunin. This did not bode well with the ancient patriarch of the Yagyu, Lord Retsudo. Angered that his son lost on a technicality, he plotted against Itto and eventually set off the events that would transform the Shogun's executioner into the assassin known as Kozure Okami (Lone Wolf and Cub).\n\nReturning home from work one evening, Itto finds his pregant wife Azami more fragile than she should be. It seems Lady Ogami has been suffering from terrible nightmares as of late, that the men Itto put to death were cursing the Ogami line. Ogami comforts his wife by explaining if the child they were expecting was a boy, why he chose the name Daigoro. Sadly, Azami's premonition comes true as she is murdered the next day. To further destroy Itto politically and literally, a death tablet bearing the emblem of the Hollyhock crest is placed in the shine he built to pray for the people he was required to execute.\n\nAnd this is where things fall apart, finding his wife dead (and Daigoro cut out of his mother's womb), Itto is devastated. The next morning, the chief inspector of the region (a Yagyu named Bizen), reveals to Itto that he is being tried for treason again his Highness, because of the blasphemous memorial tablet rumored to be in the Ogami memorial shrine. Itto-completely perplexed by such an accusation-agrees to let Bizen investigate the rumor, only to find that there is such a tablet in the shrine!\n\nWhile Bizen expects Itto to accept his fate of seppuku and slay both himself and his newborn son, Ogami soon smells a rat and realizes that the Ura Yagyu (the shadow Yagyu clan led by Retsudo) are behind this plot to undo him. After he refuses to kill himself and his son, Itto proceeds to cut through the Yagyu guards sent to ensure that Ogami follows the order through. Instead, a deal is made between Retsudo and Itto; a quick battle to decide if Itto will live outside of the region of Edo, or die right then and there, Ogami swears vengeance on the Yagyu clan and thus takes his son into Meifumado (Hell). Becoming an assassin and leaving his official samurai life behind, Itto can strike back at his most hated foes and eventually bring down the clan who murdered his wife and ruined his House.\n\nFor 500 gold pieces and the condition that every aspect of why the employer wants the assassination done, Itto now known as Kozure Okami, sets about bringing his own brand of justice to the realm, all the while teaching Daigoro what it means to be samurai. And what a journey it is. Pushing his son around Japan in a souped up wooden, metal and bamboo baby cart, it's a strange and loving testament between father and son.\n\nThere is little autobiographical data on Itto save for the following: He claimed he was from the Sakushu region of Japan, has served the Shogun for 27 years, and is a master of \"suemono giri\" (cutting through stationery objects). Another note: his name might not really be a name but the title \"sacred sword\" which almost sounds like a translation of his name.\n\n(Source: Ninjadojo)",

However, Chizome became hopeless and despaired after seeing the school's \"fundamental decay\"; that the students there were becoming Heroes for the money and personal gain. Disillusioned by the reality of Heroics, Chizome dropped out during the summer of his freshman year.\n\nAfter dropping out of high school, the teenaged Chizome preached an ideology which he called the \"Revival of Heroics\" through street oratory speeches and soapbox speeches. However, no one listened to him.\n\nOver the following decade, Chizome realized that only action will create his ideal world and change Heroics for the better; Chizome researched and disciplined himself in the training of the killing arts through self-study; he did this in order to achieve his duty of \"Revival of Heroics\". During this decade, Chizome's parents died (it is unknown what led to their deaths but it is believed that Chizome was not involved).\n\nAfter completing his training in the killing arts, Chizome took up the mantle of Hero Killer Stain and begun advocating the \"Revival of Heroics\". In this ideology of \"Revival of Heroics\", Chizome (now known as Stain) stated the guidelines of being a Hero; that Heroes must not desire rewards or compensation, people can only have the title of Hero when they commit the ultimate acts of self-sacrifice. The ideology stated that the \"Heroes\" of the modern world are fakes who pretend to be Heroes.\n\nStain then begun implementing his \"Revival of Heroics\" by killing Pro Heroes, deciding that he would not stop his purge of the Pro Heroes until the world realized the flaw in the Heroics system. Stain's end goal with implementing his ideology \"Revival of Heroics\" was to create a just world filled with true Heroes.\n\n(Source: Boku no Hero Academia Wikia)",

By the way, the \"self-introduction\" he always does before a fight (soaring male's spirit and so on...) is Hirato's idea. It is essential that every person who applies for a fighter position submits one personally, but since Yogi himself hadn't thought about it until the application period came, he left it to his superior Hirato, who with a gentle, smiling face submitted some outrageous things. But it is well received by the Children, so he quite likes it now. Yogi comes from a small, remote country. He apparently has a younger sister.\n\nThe \"yo\" in Yogi's name means \"participate in, give, award, impart, provide, cause\" and \"gi\" is \"ceremony, rule, affair, case, a matter.\"\n(Source: extra pages from chapter 18)\n\nCircus Second Ship's Fighter.

His weapons are two thorn-like épées and the name of his special attack is Dornkiste (German for \"thorn chest\").\n\nLater is revealed that Yogi was the prince from a small country.\nIn chapter 61 it is shown that Yogi's closest person to him was his little sister who was killed by Varuga, and in the same chapter is also revealed that sometimes Yogi develops a split personality called \"Silver Yogi.\" His other self with silvered hair, is quite playful, powerful and if necessary will kill with no hesitation. It is hinted that this comes from a past trauma and the experiments he suffered being fused with Varuga, as it is hinted in chapter 62 that his family and everyone in his whole hometown were killed in front of him and he was probably the sole survivor. Right after the tragedy little Yogi went berserk and his unstable powers drew the attention of Circus. Tsukitachi and Hirato were sent to investigate and found Yogi crying, completely out of control. Hirato attempted to kill him but gave up when little Yogi offered no resistance and decided to save him instead. Yogi uses a small patch in his face to stop him from changing into \"Silver Yogi.\" Also, unlike Yogi, \"Silver Yogi\" remembers his tragic past.",

It also seems to generate otherworldly purple streaks as it slices, as seen when he cut down Zoro and when he split Don Krieg's ship in half. He can tear pirate ships apart with a single, unseen slash of his sword, blocking bullets with a simple turn of his sword, and he can easily defend against even legendary swords with a small, inch-long knife concealed in the cross he wears around his neck.\n\nIn appearance, Mihawk wears very decorative, ornate, black-and-red clothing. His most identifiable clothing would be his wide-rimmed hat adorned with a large piece of fluff, a long, black cloak, and his cross necklace and sword.

Road has an affinity for candies and blood, as well as a childlike enjoyment of birthday-reminiscent themes.\n\nRoad has a plethora of supernatural abilities, ranging from the ability to travel to an alternate dimension through a door that appears at her will to complete regeneration after injury. Her dimensional space is in the form of a wrapped present, while her weapons of choice are levitating candles that can be sharpened to waxen stakes. While inside her personal dimension, she can control nonliving objects within the area; For instance, her stake-like candles fly to attack at her will. She has absolute control of everything in her dimension ranging from her appearing out of the floor, creating a copy of Lavi to crumbling his Innocence. Outside of her dimension she has displayed Telekinetic powers.\n\nRoad's personality and home life are surprisingly normal, despite her role as a villain. She has a childlike need to be entertained at all times, usually by the Earl's parasol Lero, and forces Tyki to entertain her when Lero will not. She shows a tendency to procrastinate on schoolwork, like many children her age, and appears to be in trouble for skipping classes often. Despite her childlike tendencies, she has also shown signs of extreme sadism and seems to enjoy watching the suffering of others, including stabbing Allen through the eye, killing an Akuma subordinate for no other reason then to anger Allen, and nailing Miranda’s hands to a clock while writing profanity on the wall in her blood.\n\nHer relationships with the other members of the Noah family all vary on a basis quite similar to a normal family situation; She looks up to Tyki as an older brother and is very close to him, while the twins appear to bicker with her often in a sibling-like, affectionate manner. Her relationship with Skin is unknown, as almost no interaction between the two is shown in the series. She also seems to have feelings for Allen Walker, as she kisses him upon seeing him again. Tyki finds this surprising, as the only one she kissed before was the Earl.\n\nDespite Road's young appearance, she is considered the First Child by Debit and Jasdero, which suggests that she was the first Noah to awaken in the current generation. Due to this fact, she is the only Noah capable of programming Noah's Ark, and appears to have the favoritism of the Millennium Earl. She represents Noah's \"Dreams\".

He is enamored by cute things and thus favors Poplar over the other employees due to her cute appearance. He voices his thoughts out loud and occasionally offends his co-workers, often resulting in him getting punished by them. He usually finds his co-workers and the rules of the restaurant to be strange, but he still has an attachment to his job. He is able to adapt quickly to his job at the restaurant. He has three older sisters and it is because of them that caused his dislike for older women as he had been tormented by them all his life. He received hand-me-downs from his sisters when he was young, giving him the appearance of a little girl. He also has a younger sister in elementary school who is almost as tall as he is. Despite his problems, Inami asks Souta to cross-dress, using the name Kotori, when her father comes to visit her at work.\n\nHe develops feelings for Inami in season 2, but he's unaware of it. In season 3, after much internal conflict, he realizes in episode 10 that he does indeed like Inami.\n\nAt the end of the series he confesses to Inami and they become a couple.",
